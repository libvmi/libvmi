 * the many uses of memory introspection without needing to focus on the
 * low-level details of introspection.  If you are using this library and
 * come up with a useful extension to it, we are always happy to receive
 * patches.
 *
 * Please direct all questions about XenAccess to the Google Group:
 * http://groups.google.com/group/xenaccess
 *
 * The project was created and is maintained by Bryan D. Payne, who is
 * currently working towards his PhD in Computer Science at Georgia Tech.

 * @section intro Introduction
 * @subsection intro1 What is XenAccess?
 * XenAccess is a library that simplifies the process of memory introspection
 * for virtual machines running on the Xen hypervisor.  With XenAccess, your
 * software can run in one virtual machine and access the memory space of
 * other virtual machines.  While the Xen Control Library (libxc), which is
 * included with Xen, provides the ability to access another virtual 
 * machine's memory at a low level, XenAccess allows you to access memory
 * using kernel symbols, virtual addresses, and physical addresses.
 *
 * XenAccess also provides the ability to parse memory dumps stored in raw
 * memory files (i.e., any file where an offset into the file equals a
 * physical address in the memory space).  This is a common memory dump 
 * format used in the digital forensic community and can also be useful
 * for testing programs built using XenAccess.  To create a memory dump
 * from a Xen virtual machine, you can use the dump-memory.c example
 * application included with XenAccess.
 *
 * @subsection intro2 What is memory introspection?
 * Memory introspection is the process of viewing the memory of one virtual
 * machine from a different virtual machine.  On the surface, this sounds
 * rather simple.  In fact, Xen provides a function to facilitate this type
 * of memory access.  What makes memory introspection difficult is the
 * semantic gap between the two virtual machines.  For example, to lookup
 * virtual addresses XenAccess must walk the page tables inside the other
 * virtual machine.  However, to walk these page tables, XenAccess must 
 * first know where the page directory is located (i.e., the CR3 value).
 * And this value depends on the process address space you are viewing.
 * The more you think about the problem, the reasons for its difficulty
 * become clear.  One must know a lots of details about the target operating
 * system in order to build these higher levels of abstraction.
 *
 * @image html intro-detail.png XenAccess must take several steps to access a memory page based on a kernel symbol in Linux.
 * The figure above shows the steps that XenAccess takes to access a page of
 * memory using a kernel symbol.  This figure is focused on Linux, however the
 * procedure for Windows is similar.  Instead of using the System.map file,
 * kernel symbols are converted to virtual addresses using the export values
 * from ntoskrnl.exe.
 *
 * Memory introspection is useful because it allows you to monitor (reading
 * memory values and control (writing memory values)
 * an operating system from a protected location.  Previous research has 
 * shown that introspection can be used for a wide variety of security
 * applications, but more ideas are coming out all the time.  Using XenAccess,
 * you can quickly experiment with your new ideas and help advance this
 * new an exciting research direction.
 *
 *
 * @section install Installation
 * @subsection install0 Requirements
 * XenAccess is designed for 32-bit x86 systems running Xen.  Users have
 * reported success with all recent Xen versions (3.0.x through 3.3.x).
 * Please report you success and problems through the XenAccess Google
 * Group or on the XenAccess wiki so that we can continue to make this 
 * a better tool for everyone.  To see specific details about how XenAccess
 * works on different versions of Xen, please see our wiki:
 * http://code.google.com/p/xenaccess/wiki/CompatibleXenVersions
 *
 * @subsection install1 Getting XenAccess
 * You can get the latest released version of XenAccess from Google Code
 * using the following link:
 * http://code.google.com/p/xenaccess/
 *
 * You can also grab the development version directly from the subversion
 * repository.  Perform the checkout with the following command:
@verbatim
 svn checkout http://xenaccess.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/libxa xenaccess @endverbatim
 *
 * If you are just getting started with XenAccess, you probably want to 
 * use the latest released version.  However, if you need a new feature that
 * hasn't been released, or you are planning on submitting a patch, then you
 * may want to try the development version.
 *
 * @subsection install2 Building XenAccess
 * Before compiling XenAccess, you should make sure that you have a standard
 * development environment installed including gcc, make, autoconf, etc.
 * You will also need the libxc library and the libxenstore library, which are
 * included with a typical Xen installation.  Note that you will need the
 * development versions of these libraries, meaning that you may need to
 * install a package such as 'xen-devel' that is included with your Linux
 * distribution.  Finally, you will need the lex yacc libraries (often called
 * flex and bison).  XenAccess uses the standard GNU build system.  To compile
 * the library, follow the steps shown below.
@verbatim
./autogen.sh
./configure
make @endverbatim
 *
 * Note that you can specify options to the configure script to specify, for
 * example, the installation location.  Of note is the '--disable-xen' option,
 * which allows you to build XenAccess without support for Xen (in this case
 * you only get support for working with memory files).  For a complete list
 * of configure options, run:
@verbatim
./configure --help @endverbatim
 *
 * @subsection install3 Installing XenAccess
 * Installation is optional.  This is useful if you will be developing code
 * to use the XenAccess library.  However, if you are just running the examples,
 * then there is no need to do an installation.  If you choose to install
 * XenAccess, you can do it using the steps shown below:
@verbatim
su 
make install @endverbatim
 *
 * Note that this will install XenAccess under the install prefix spcified to
 * the configure script.  If you did not specify an install prefix, then
 * XenAccess is installed under /usr/local.
 *
 * @subsection install4 Configuring XenAccess
 * In order to work properly, XenAccess requires that you install a
 * configuration file.  This file has a set of entries for each domain that 
 * XenAccess will access.  These entries specify things such as the OS type
 * (e.g., Linux or Windows), the location of symbolic information, and offsets
 * used to access data within the domain.  The file format is relatively
 * straight forward.  The generic format is shown below:
@verbatim
<domain name> {
    <key> = <value>;
    <key> = <value>;
} @endverbatim
 *
 * The domain name is what appears when you use the 'xm list' command.  There
 * are 14 different keys available for use.  The ostype and sysmap
 * keys are used by both Linux and Windows domains.  The available keys are
 * listed below:
 *
 * @li @c ostype Linux or Windows guests are supported.
 * @li @c sysmap The path to the System.map file or the exports file (details below).
 * @li @c linux_tasks The number of bytes (offset) from the start of the struct until task_struct->tasks from linux/sched.h in the domain's kernel.
 * @li @c linux_mm Offset to task_struct->mm.
 * @li @c linux_pid Offset to task_struct->pid.
 * @li @c linux_pgd Offset to mm_struct->pgd.
 * @li @c linux_addr Offset to mm_struct->start_code.
 * @li @c win_tasks Offset to EPROCESS->ActiveProcessLinks.
 * @li @c win_pdbase Offset to EPROCESS->Pcb->DirectoryTableBase.
 * @li @c win_pid Offset to EPROCESS->UniqueProcessId.
 * @li @c win_peb Offset to EPROCESS->Peb.
 * @li @c win_iba Offset to EPROCESS->Peb->ImageBaseAddress.
 * @li @c win_ph Offset to EPROCESS->Peb->ProcessHeap.
 *
 * All of the offsets can be specified in either hex or decimal.  For hex, the
 * number should be preceeded with a '0x'.  An example configuration file is
 * shown below:
@verbatim
Fedora-HVM {
    sysmap      = "/boot/System.map-2.6.18-1.2798.fc6";
    ostype      = "Linux";
    linux_tasks = 268;
    linux_mm    = 276;
    linux_pid   = 312;
    linux_pgd   = 40;
    linux_addr  = 132;
}

WinXPSP2 {
    ostype      = "Windows";
    win_tasks   = 0x88;
    win_pdbase  = 0x18;
    win_pid     = 0x84;
    win_peb     = 0x1b0;
    win_iba     = 0x8;
    win_ph      = 0x18;
} @endverbatim
 *
 * You can specify as many domains as you wish in this configuration file.
 * When you are done creating this file, it must be saved to
 * /etc/xenaccess.conf.
 *
 * @section examples Example Code
 * @subsection examples1 Included Examples
 * XenAccess comes with a variety of small examples to demonstrate how to use
 * the library.  These are also useful for checking that you have successfully
 * completed the build and configuration steps described in the section above.
 * The first argument for each example is the domain ID that you wish to view.
 * This should be the same ID seen using the 'xm list' command.  The domain
 * you specify must also be included in the configuration file.  The provided
 * examples are listed below.  The arguments passed on the command line to each
 * program are specified in squared brackets.
 *
 * @li @c dump-memory [domain id, filename] Dumps the entire physical memory image from a virtual machine into a file.  This image can then be used with the file access capabilities of XenAccess (e.g., see the 'process-list-file' example below).
 * @li @c map-addr [domain id, virtual address] Dumps a memory page to stdout based on the provided virtual address.  The virtual address must be a kernel virtual address.  The page is displayed in a readable format complete with hex, ascii, and offsets.  The number printed before the memory page is the offset of the specified address within the page.
 * @li @c map-symbol [domain id, kernel symbol] Same as @c map-addr except you specify a kernel symbol instead of a kernel virtual address.
 * @li @c module-list [domain id] Lists the kernel modules installed in the operating system.  This is the same list that you would get using 'lsmod' on a Linux system.  On Windows, it lists the drivers loaded into the kernel.
 * @li @c process-data [domain id, process id] Displays the first memory page of executable content for a given process.  The process number, which is provided as a second argument, is the number obtained from using the @c process-list example above.
 * @li @c process-list [domain id] Lists the running processes in the operating system.  This is the same list that you would get using 'ps -ef' on a Linux system.  On Windows, it is the same list that you would get using the task manager.
 * @li @c process-list-file [filename] Same as above, but this works from a memory dump file, specified by the filename.
 *
 * @subsection examples2 In Detail: process-list.c
 * In order to better understand how the examples work, let's take a look at
 * one of the more interesting examples.  The @c process-list example displays
 * the processes running in an operating system by walking down the linked
 * list data structure containing process information.  For each process, the
 * name and ID are extracted and printed to stdout.  To see how this is done,
 * we will step through the code one piece at a time.
 *
@verbatim
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <xenaccess/xenaccess.h>
#include <xenaccess/xa_private.h> @endverbatim
 *
 * The include list is not too surprising.  Note that xa_private.h is included
 * here, but this is only to access the function that prints a memory page to
 * stdout.  Most people will not need to include xa_private.h.
 *
@verbatim
#define TASKS_OFFSET 24 * 4
#define PID_OFFSET 39 * 4 
#define NAME_OFFSET 108 * 4
#define ActiveProcessLinks_OFFSET 0x88
#define UniqueProcessId_OFFSET 0x84
#define ImageFileName_OFFSET 0x174 @endverbatim
 *
 * These offset values are important as they will allow us to find the
 * necessary data within the data structures we traverse.  The first three
 * offsets are used for Linux systems and obtained by looking at the definition
 * of task_struct.  The second three offsets are used for Windows systems and
 * obtained using windbg to view the EPROCESS struct.
 *
@verbatim
    uint32_t dom = atoi(argv[1]);

    if (xa_init_vm_id_strict(dom, &xai) == XA_FAILURE){
        perror("failed to init XenAccess library");
        goto error_exit;
    } @endverbatim
 *
 * Next we read in the domain ID to look at.  (Yes, there is no error
 * checking here so the program will seg fault if you fail to specify a
 * domain ID as an argument.)  Then we make our first call to XenAccess.
 * This call initializes the instance data structure.  Note that we only 
 * perform this initialization step once as it is a costly function call.
 *
 * From this point forward, all of the error checking code will be omited
 * from the sake of clarity.  In addition, we will only focus on the Linux
 * version of the code.  The Windows version operates in a similar fashion.
 * To see the complete version of the code, look in the examples directory
 * of your copy of XenAccess.
 *
@verbatim
    memory = xa_access_kernel_sym(&xai, "init_task", &offset, PROT_READ);
    memcpy(&next_process, memory + offset + TASKS_OFFSET, 4);
    list_head = next_process;
    munmap(memory, xai.page_size); @endverbatim
 *
 * The kernel symbol 'init_task' points to the beginning of the process list
 * in the Linux kernel.  So we map this memory location and then copy the 
 * pointer to the next process into both the list_head and next_process
 * variables.  The task list is a circular linked list, so we will use 
 * list_head to know when we have visited every process.  The next step here 
 * is to unmap the memory, since we are done with this page.  This is 
 * important to remember since you can only map a limited number of pages at
 * a time.  Just as you would free memory after a malloc, you should unmap
 * these pages after you are done using them.
 *
@verbatim
    while (1){
        memory = xa_access_kernel_va(&xai, next_process, &offset, PROT_READ);
        memcpy(&next_process, memory + offset, 4);

        if (list_head == next_process){
            break;
        }

        name = (char *) (memory + offset + NAME_OFFSET - TASKS_OFFSET);
        memcpy(&pid, memory + offset + PID_OFFSET - TASKS_OFFSET, 4);
        printf("[%5d] %s\n", pid, name);
        munmap(memory, xai.page_size);
    } @endverbatim
 *
 * This loop is the bulk of the program.  We map the memory page associated
 * with the next process.  For this process we check to see if it is the
 * init_task process.  If so then we are done.  If not, then we print out
 * the process information.  Note that we are obtaining this information
 * directly from the task_struct in memory of the running Linux system that
 * we are looking at.  When we are done with this memory page, we unmap it
 * and repeat the loop.
 *
@verbatim
    if (memory) munmap(memory, xai.page_size);
    xa_destroy(&xai); @endverbatim
 *
 * The final step is cleanup.  We perform a sanity check to make sure that 
 * there are no mapped memory pages.  And then we call xa_destroy to free
 * any memory associated with the XenAccess instance.
 *
 * @subsection examples3 Running the Examples
 * A quick way to see XenAccess in action is to try out the example code.  You
 * should be running Xen, and running the example code as root in domain 0.
 * You should have at least one user domain running and the configuration file
 * setup for this domain.  Note the domain ID using the 'xm list' command:
 *
@verbatim
[root@bluemoon libxa]# xm list
Name                                      ID Mem(MiB) VCPUs State   Time(s)
Domain-0                                   0     1229     2 r----- 137356.4
Fedora-HVM                                 4      384     1 -b----   2292.6
fc5                                        5      384     1 -b----     15.4
[root@bluemoon libxa]# @endverbatim
 *
 * Then you can run the examples as follows:
 *
@verbatim
[root@bluemoon libxa]# cd examples/
[root@bluemoon examples]# ./module-list 5

[root@bluemoon examples]# @endverbatim
 *
 * Note that the example code works for both para-virtualized (i.e., PV) and
 * fully-virtualized (i.e., HVM) domains.  However, the example code uses the
 * offsets you provide in the configuration file, and some hard coded offsets
 * in the example code, to locate information in the running kernels.  For
 * this reason you may find that it fails on some kernels.

 *
 * Here we see that @c process-list works on one of the domains, but not the
 * other.  This is because the examples were written with a specific kernel 
 * version in mind.  Your code will need to be built to work with the specific
 * system that you plan on viewing.  Future versions of XenAccess will provide
 * tools to help simplify the process of finding the right offset values.
 *
 *
 * @section devel Programming With XenAccess
 * Most people that are familiar with C and familiar with OS data structure
 * layout will find that programming with XenAccess is pretty straight forward.
 * You can probably just look at the example code and be off and running
 * quickly.  However, there are a few things to keep in mind when working
 * with introspection that will make your life easier and improve the 
 * performance of your applications.  This section provides some tips to help
 * you get started.
 *
 * Note:  This section provides some preliminary ideas and help.  If you
 * find other tips that could be added to this section, please send a note
 * to the XenAccess Google Group.
 *
 * @subsection devel1 Best Practices for Performance
 * Performance is a key concern when building any application that uses 
 * introspection.  Since some of the library operations are costly, if you
 * aren't careful, your application can run very slowly.  In most cases, this
 * can be avoided with a little planning.  The two stratigies to keep in mind
 * are (1) do as much work as possible during initialization, and (2) avoid
 * algorithms that map the same page of memory repeatedly.
 *
 * The first step is to do your costly work during initialization.  This
 * includes your call to @c xa_init.  You should call this function once during
 * the initialization of your application and then pass the instance around
 * to all functions that need to use the XenAccess API.  XenAccess is 
 * designed to do as much work as possible during initialization, so a call
 * to @c xa_init is costly.  If you call it several times then your application
 * performance will certainly suffer.
 *
 * The second step is to be mindful of what you are doing.  For example, an
 * algorithm that searches memory looking for a particular pattern should not
 * be using XenAccess to access each virtual address in the search range
 * independently.  Instead, use XenAccess to map a page of memory once.  Then
 * look at each address on that page before unmapping it and proceeding to the
 * next page.  These considerations can improve your application's performance
 * by several orders of magnitude.
 *
 * Finally, you can enable the debug output (see Debugging section below) to 
 * identify when XenAccess is getting cache hits and cache misses.  The default
 * cache size is 25 entries, however some applications may benefit from a 
 * larger cache.  You can adjust the cache size by changing the 
 * @c XA_CACHE_SIZE variable in @c xa_private.h and then recompiling 
 * XenAccess.  However, keep in mind that a larger cache size does not always
 * equal better performance.  Experiment to see what works best for your
 * particular application.
 *
 * @subsection devel3 Debugging
 * XenAccess includes the ability to show debugging output.  This output is
 * very verbose, but may be useful when tracking down bugs in your application
 * or in XenAccess itself.  To enable the debug output, uncomment the 
 * @c XA_DEBUG variable near the top of the @c xenaccess.h file.  After
 * uncommenting this variable, you will need to recompile XenAccess (and,
 * optionally, reinstall XenAccess).  With the debug output enabled, you will
 * see lots of information on stdout about XenAccess's operation.
 *
 * If you are requesting help from the XenAccess Google Group, please send
 * the debug output along with your question as it will be easier to diagnose your
 * problem this way.
 *
 * @subsection devel4 Bridging the Semantic Gap
 * XenAccess provides simplified access to a user domain's memory by allowing
 * you to access virtual and physical addresses.  However, knowing which
 * address to access can be a challenging problem by itself.  If you were
 * working on the machine locally, you would have a richer set of API calls
 * to gather the information you need.  Bridging this semantic gap requires
 * learning details about how an operating system and its programs are loaded
 * into memory.
 *
 * When available, source code provides an invaluable resource for
 * understanding how data is organized in memory.  When source code is not
 * available, or when need a higher-level understanding of the system's 
 * operation, then I recommend finding a useful reference book.  The two 
 * operating system references that seem to be most useful when working with
 * XenAccess are listed below:
 *
 * @li Understanding the Linux Kernel by Bovet and Cesati
 * @li Windows Internals by Russinovich and Solomon
 *
 * In addition to these books, the forensics community has done a lot of
 * work in volitale memory analysis.  This body of knowledge is very relavent
 * to work with XenAccess because it involves a similar view of the system's
 * memory.  The links below are some recommended sources of information within
 * this forensics community:
 *
 * @li <a href="http://computer.forensikblog.de/en/">int for(ensic){blog;}</a>
 * @li <a href="http://www.4tphi.net/fatkit/">Forensic Analysis Toolkit (FATKit)</a>
 * @li <a href="http://dfrws.org/archives.shtml">DFRWS Conference Archives</a>
 *
 * @section problems Troubleshooting
 * When troubleshoot your application, it is best to be able to see what is 
 * going on.  If you think that the problem is within XenAccess, you can 
 * try enabling the debug output to identify the problem.  If you think that
 * you have found a bug in XenAccess, please send an email with this debug
 * output and a description of the bug to the mailing list.
 *
 * If you want to see the memory maping by your application, consider using
 * the @c print_hex function, which will require you to include
 * @c xa_private.h in your application.  This function allows you to easily
 * print the hex and ascii values from a region of memory to stdout, which
 * can often simplify debugging.
