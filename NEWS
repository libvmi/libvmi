Release 0.10 
    Build system improvements:
        Compiling on OS X now possible
        Improved Xen and KVM detection
        Ability to build Xen driver without necessity for libxenstore
        Test suite for manual use and continuous integration 
    API enhancements:
        Exposure of number of VM VCPUs if known 
        Exposure of VM address width if known
        Windows user-space symbol to virtual address lookup
        Custom initialization functions accepting a hashtable rather than 
          relying upon libvmi.conf
        Page table lookup helper function now exposed in public headers
        VCPU register modification capabilities 
          Note: currently only available for Xen VMs
        Support for Xen Events (Requires CPU with Intel EPT and Xen version 
            4.1.2+)
          Page-granular memory events
          Byte-granular physical address memory events

          CR0, CR3, CR4 write events 
            Note: Xen 4.2.0 experienced a regression preventing CR3/CR4 events 
                from working. Xen 4.2.1+, and Xen 4.1.2 do not suffer from this
                issue. 
        Exposing peparse.h as part of LibVMI to aid in Windows PE validation,
            gaining access to the PE headers and the Image Data Directories
            entries (the export table is natively supported)
        Page mode can now be accessed in partial init
        Windows version can be determined in partial init provided a physical
             address is given to the kernel
    Hypervisor support:
        Xen improvements tracking 4.1.x, 4.2.x, and 4.3.x
